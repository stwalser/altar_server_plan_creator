# Altar Server Plan Creator
This Python application assigns altar servers automatically to different masses. The masses, the 
altar servers and other information must be specified in four different .yaml files.

## Usage
The script requires four `.yaml` files called `altar_servers.yaml`, `custom_masses.yaml`, 
`holy_masses.yaml` and `plan_info.yaml`. They must be located in the `config/` folder.

### altar_servers.yaml
