# Altar Server Plan Creator

This Python application assigns altar servers automatically to different masses. The masses, the 
altar servers and other information must be specified in four different .yaml files.

## Usage

The script requires three `.json` files called `altar_servers.yaml`, `holy_masses.yaml` and `plan_info.yaml`. They must be located in the `config/` folder.

### altar_servers.yaml

### holy_masses.yaml

### plan_info.yaml
